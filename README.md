# VtNetCore.UWP - Virtual terminal for Universal Windows Platform

## Brief

This code is very much... not ready yet

It is under active development and may or may not be dropped when we decide on which windowing toolkit to use.

## License

It's open, but we haven't settled on the license yet. It'll be MIT or Apache
